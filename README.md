Traffic Cone is an isometric tile based game engine written for html5. It's currently in it's infancy but has the base level of client side functionality needed do some impressive 2d or 2d isometric games. It makes complex animations of sprites and tiles based worlds fairly simple. 

Traffic Cone is currently client side only. There are some scaffolding code representing a game server using nodejs that are currently in this repository, but they're cursory at best. Expect to see more on this front soon, we're actively working on Traffic Cone server.

Our documentation is also still pending and in a state of flux, but check out the /examples folders for some interesting samples of how to fire up and work with the engine. They will work with any standard webserver but for a quick test, install nodejs, run webserver.js and then hit any of the example paths via http://localhost:8089/examples/filenamehere
